# File-Structure

This template outlines the recommended file structure for the Red Team.

## Guiding Principle

The main goal of this file structure is to keep related components, utilities, and assets close together. This makes it easier to understand the relationships between components and to maintain and scale the project over time.

If a component, utility, or asset is used across multiple components, it should be placed in a dedicated folder, such as assets, context, or hooks. This ensures that the project remains organized and makes it easier to find what you need.

## Things to Consider

- Component Reusability: Think about the components in your project and how they can be reused across different pages or sections. This can help keep the project organized and reduce code duplication.

- Contextual Relevance: Consider where each component or asset is being used in the project and try to keep them as close as possible to their point of use. This makes it easier to understand the relationships between components and can help reduce the complexity of the project.

- Consistency: Consistency is key when organizing a project. Make sure to use a consistent naming convention and file structure throughout the project to make it easier to navigate and maintain.

- Scalability: Consider the future growth of the project and make sure the file structure can accommodate it. A scalable file structure should be able to accommodate new components and pages without becoming too cluttered or difficult to navigate.
